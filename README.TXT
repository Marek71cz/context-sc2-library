This plugin adds context menu to Stream Cinema 2.0, for movies and TV show episodes - Add to library. This adds selected item to a user defined library and runs the scan of the library.
To work properly, correct folders for movie and TV shows library must be defined in this plugin. Current version only works for movies, does not add TV Shows to library! To be done in the future.
